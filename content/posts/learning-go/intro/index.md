Hey there, I'm Gal, a software team lead from Israel. I'm also a big fantasy books fan, runner, and MTB enthusiast.
My background is mainly in JS but I did get to dabble with different programming languages in uni & work so the notion of compiled statically typed languages is familiar to me (just a bit)

## What

A series of posts showcasing various coding questions, AoC problems, general programming in Go, and probably a random thought here and there

## Why

The purpose of these blog posts is mainly to make me think critically and dive into specific aspects of the Go language.
Getting some harsh, honest feedback is always great, and what better way to get it than posting my code on the internet for everyone to talk shit about?!
I do hope that this series will help different people to learn Go or just have fun with various coding questions

## Who

Who is this for?
Well, just about anyone. You can be a complete beginner or an experienced veteran, either way, you might learn something new and just have fun following along
