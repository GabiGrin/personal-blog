In my [2023 goals post](https://www.galelmalah.com/posts/2023-goals/#project--team-management), I mentioned that one of my objectives is to improve my skills as a team manager by reading two books on the subject. One of the books I had in mind was _"The Five Dysfunction of a Team"_.  
I already heard a lot of great things about this book from a couple colleagues and the reviews on [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21343.The_Five_Dysfunctions_of_a_Team) are mostly positive, so I was excited to find that Orly Tokov, our group ops manager, had left the book on my desk.

I couldn't wait to dive into _"The Five Dysfunctions of a Team"_, so I read it in one sitting the day after. Here are my thoughts and notes on the book.

## Quick Summary

_don't want to read the all thing? this section will give you a brief description of the book._

First of all I think the author did a great job delivering the book main ideas in an exciting story like way.

### The Story

The book begins with the company "DecisionTech", once considered the next big thing, really, they had it all, funding, top notch executive team and a great product **but** two years later they find themselves lacking behind the competition and struggling to stay in the game.

The board chairman decides to get a new CEO, **Kathryn** (our hero). Kathryn has no experience in the tech world and she's not the usual "high tech" persona.
For the first few weeks of her job Kathryn just observe her upper management team and takes notes on how they work as a team.

> The author also made sure to introduce each team member in a manner that gives us, the readers, all the context we need.

After Kathryn decides shes seen enough, she starts acting on her assessments. That is that the upper management team is a **Dysfunctional** team.  
She then slowly expose the team to the **Five Dysfunctions** and take them to a journey that passes through each dysfunction.  
Like every great journey, its filled with peril, fear, struggles and wins.
People quit, breakdown and new people join.

At the end, The team become more trusting of one another, they are not afraid to get into arguments and most importantly they put the company goals above their personal ones (ego driven goals).

Here are the 5 Dysfunctions as presented in the book

![5 dysfunctions pyramid](./media/5-dysfunctions.jpg)

Its not by accident that they are presented as a pyramid, according to the author, each dysfunction facilitate the one above it.

For example lets take the first one **Absence of Trust**:

Team members are afraid to be vulnerable with one another, meaning, they conceal their weakness, withholds their opinion and are afraid to ask for help.

This leads to **Fear of Conflict** Because **people don't like to feel stupid** and if you are afraid to be vulnerable with your team you won't speak your mind because you might be wrong, therefore you avoid conflict.  
This results in a shallow discussion of important topics, people just nods in agreement or resorts to some toxic behavior like making their opinions known after the fact, behind the back of the team.

### Main Takeaways

- As a team lead, you should be the main driver of your team success and lead by example.  
  Meaning, you expect them to be vulnerable? first be vulnerable yourself, admit your mistakes, ask for help and open up.  
  You expect them to hold each other accountable? Make sure you are doing the same.  
  You expect them to make their work visible? do the same.
- Trust is an important aspect of team building that need to be actively worked on. This can be done by creating real relationships in the team, talking about personal aspects of your life, beside work.
- Make your work visible. ask for team to communicate and update the team in a clear way, what do I mean by that?  
   Here are a couple of examples
  - Got an important issue resolved? Share it with the team.
  - Have a question? Ask the entire team.
  - Send PR's in the team slack.
    In general, increase the visibility of work being done in your team.
- Encourage discussion within the team by proactively asking for feedback in team discussions, given enough time and trust those discussion will occur naturally without you (the team lead) driving them.
- DECIDE! Don't let arguments end in an ambiguity, either decide on action yourself or encourage the team to resolve them in a clear way.
- Make sure expectations and deliverables are clearly defined and get team members to commit to those efforts and raise any concerns they might have.

### Favorite Quotes

_Before we dive into the five dysfunction, here are a couple of quotes from the book that I liked :)_

> "If you could get all the people in an organization rowing in the same direction, you could dominate any industry, in any market, against any competition, at any time."

> "A fractured team is just like a broken arm or leg; fixing it is always painful, and sometimes you have to re-break it to make it heal correctly. And the re-break hurts a lot more than the initial break, because you have to do it on purpose."

> "If we don't trust one another, then we aren't going to engage in open, constructive, ideological conflict, And we'll just continue to preserve a sense of **artificial harmony**."

## Absence of Trust

Team members exhibit invulnerability, they are afraid to show their weakness, share their opinions with the team, and admit when they are wrong.

### Signs of Absence of Trust

- Hide their weakness.
- Afraid to ask questions/help.
- Afraid to give help.
- Hold grudges over unresolved issues.
- Fail to take advantage of their team members strength.
- Covering up mistakes or failing to admit them.

### Ways to Build Trust

- Team activities
- Encourage discussions about their personal life.  
  This can be done by having each member to answer a list of questions or more naturally by sharing something yourself and asking other to share as well.
- By example, admit when you are wrong, ask for help and make you work visible.

> I didn't practically liked those personality tests they suggest in the book. In my opinion they are too random and often time are just wrong.

## Fear of Conflict

Team members avoid discussion on important topics all together or engage in a shallow passionless discussion that often end with no resolution.

We are part of a generation that is thought to steer clear of any conflict and conform to the norms, this makes conflicts an hard thing to do and even harder to do right.

> The author describes lack of conflict as "Artificial Harmony", I couldn't agree more with that statement.

### Signs of Fear of Conflict

- Personal grudges.
- Silently nodding in agreement.
- Toxic behavior like rolling their eyes or throwing some smirky remarks.
- "I told you so" mentality.

### Ways to Drive Conflict

- Ask questions.
- Point out the importance of conflict.
- Make sure to eliminate any toxic remarks or behavior the minute they happen, at times, visibly in front of the team.
- Build trust 😏
- Encourage asking questions and discussions.

> We are talking about constructive conflict and not personal, spiteful conflict.
